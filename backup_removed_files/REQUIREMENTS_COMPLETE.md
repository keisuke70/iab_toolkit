### Advanced User Profiling System
```python
@dataclass
class UserProfile:
    age_range: str           # "25-35", "30-45", etc.
    geekiness_level: int     # 1-10 scale
    sophistication: str      # "basic", "intermediate", "advanced"
    interests: List[str]     # Extracted interests
    likely_behaviors: List[str]  # Behavioral predictions
    confidence: float        # 0.0-1.0 confidence score
```

### Content Analysis Capabilities
